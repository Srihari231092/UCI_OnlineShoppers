# Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset
----------

Online Shopping purchasing behaviour was collected from a website over a 1 year period, and marked whether the visit ended in generating revenue or not. 

We can build a prediction model using the given information to determine if the visit will end with an item being purchased.


## Assumptions

- Data is representative of the whole population
- The values of bounce rate and Page values provided is for the final page the customer views before exiting the site
- It is more important to capture visits that will generate revenue, rather than those that do not. For example â€“ Target marketing campaigns, discount offers and other promotions etc.

## Key Insights from modeling the data

1. Pages with lower bounce rates were shown to be a strong indicator of whether the visit generates revenue
	- A drop in bounce rates by as much as 0.04 increases the odds of a customer making a purchase by 55%
	- Analysing features of pages with lower bounce rates, can provide further insights
1. Higher Page Value is a strong indicator of whether the visit generates revenue
	- 43 percent of all visits generate revenue for pages whose Page Value score is greater than 0
	- An increase of 19 units in Page Value, increases the odds of a customer making a purchase by 8 times
1. November generates most favorable traffic ratios, but months such as December have a large amount of traffic as well
	- Odds of a purchase in November increase by 275% compared to the prior months
	- Traffic in December can be targeted for conversion to generate more Revenue
